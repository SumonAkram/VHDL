# VHDL
This repository contains Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) code for simple and complex projects.

Required tools:
Hardware: DE10-Lite FPGA board (I used MAX10 10M50DAF484C7G).
Software: Quartus Prime and Questa/ModelSim.
Text Editor: Notepad++.

Guideline: Check the design requirements for each project, ensuring that each folder contains necessary files. Utilize the 'DE10_LITE_Default.csv' file for pin configuration and 'timing_fpga_config' for Quartus.
